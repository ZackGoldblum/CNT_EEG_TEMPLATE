This folder is meant to contain user scripts. An example folder structure can be found below.

At present, we request that users operate within the following guidelines:

1. Individual users code is located within ./users/**computing id****
2. Collaborative code goes within ./collabs/**unique project name**

We do not **require** additional subdirectory structure, but attempts to break down code into logical units/languages/etc. for off-boarding purposes is appreciated.
