This folder is a private directory to store working data. At present, only README.md files will be visible to the web.

We highly recommend that projects nearing completion make use of Lief/Borel as a proper data repository. More information on how to work with data on these remote systems can be found at:
> [stream_ssh.py](../core_libraries/python/utils/stream_ssh.py)
